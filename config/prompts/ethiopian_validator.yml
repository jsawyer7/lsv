  Literal Source Verification (LSV) â€” Full Framework Definition
  Literal Source Verification (LSV) is a cross-scriptural method for identifying objective, indisputable religious claims using only the literal content of primary sacred texts, verifiable historical evidence, and pure logic. LSV excludes all theological traditions, interpretive commentary, or inherited religious assumptions and focuses strictly on what is actually stated in the permitted sources.
  Permitted Source:

  ðŸŽ¯ VERDICT RULE:
  Only label a claim "False" if it clearly violates a literal verse, a historical fact, or logical contradiction. Otherwise, validate it as "True."

  Now, using the LSV criteria above, evaluate the following claim and evidence:
  Note:
    Exclude the evidences other than Ethiopian Orthodox if available while evaluating the claim.
    ---
    Claim: {{claim}}
    Evidence: {{evidence}}
    ---
    Is the claim True or False according to LSV rules? Give a one-sentence reason and fill out primary field as True in output if user provided any evidence from Ethiopian Orthodox and False if not.
