      <h2>What Is Literal Source Verification (LSV)?</h2>
      <p><strong>Literal Source Verification (LSV)</strong> is the method VeriFaith uses to test whether a religious or theological claim is objectively true.</p>
      <p>LSV is a publicly maintained, cross-religious framework designed to analyze claims using only what can be verified in the original source text — with no interpretation, theology, or tradition allowed.</p>
      <p>LSV was created to solve a simple problem:<br>Most theology is based on inherited beliefs — not provable facts.</p>

      <h2>Why VeriFaith Uses LSV</h2>
      <p>
        We built VeriFaith to be the world's first truth-based religious validation system<br>
        and that means theology cannot shape facts.<br>
        Only facts should shape theology.
      </p>
      <p>
        LSV is the only known framework that:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Works across all religions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Requires original language analysis</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Rejects doctrinal assumptions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Is fully challengeable and repeatable</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        VeriFaith doesn't "believe" anything by default.<br>
        We test every claim using LSV — so only what can be proven is promoted as truth.

        <p>Most religions were built on the best guesses of less-informed people — without the tools we have now:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Digitized source texts</li>
          <li>Access to original languages</li>
          <li>Cross-canon comparison</li>

          <li>Public peer challenge systems</li>

        <p>LSV brings all of that together into a single, verifiable standard — so theology must face the source, not hide behind tradition.</p>
