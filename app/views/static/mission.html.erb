        We're Here to Rebuild it on Verified Truth.<br><br>
        For centuries, theology was shaped by people who did the best they could â€” with very little.<br>
        They worked from incomplete texts, translations of translations, and traditions passed down as unquestioned truth.<br>
        They had almost no access to:
        <ul>
          <li>Other religious canons</li>
          <li>Original manuscripts</li>
          <li>Historical context outside their own region or sect</li>
        </ul>
        Yet these assumptions became doctrines.<br>
        Those doctrines became institutions.<br>
        And we inherited it all.

        We now live in a world where:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Every major sacred text</strong> is digitized and searchable</li>
          <li><strong>Original languages</strong> like Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Sanskrit, Pali, and Ge'ez are accessible and analyzable</li>
          <li><strong>AI can process claims</strong> using logic, linguistic accuracy, and strict source boundaries</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-religion comparison</strong> is instant and transparent</li>
        </ul>
        We have better tools than any generation before us.<br>
        It's time to stop defending inherited belief and start testing it.

      <div class="mission-clear-desc">
        <strong>Let the Facts Build the Theology Not the Other Way Around</strong><br><br>
        VeriFaith doesn't interpret. It validates.<br>
        Using our Literal Source Verification (LSV) framework, every claim must:
        <ul>
          <li>Be worded with absolute clarity</li>
          <li>Be testable against a specific source</li>
          <li>Pass AI validation using original language analysis</li>
          <li>Undergo peer and multi-model review</li>
        </ul>
        Only claims that survive this process become Facts.<br>
        Only Facts can form the building blocks of Theories.

      <h2>A Living System Where Truth Holds Power and Pressure</h2>
      <div class="mission-living-desc">
        Facts on VeriFaith aren't frozen.<br>
        They can be challenged at any time.<br>
        When a challenge is submitted, our system:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Revalidates the original claim</strong></li>
          <li>Filters all evidence through source-specific AI logic</li>
          <li>Reassesses the outcome based on updated models or stronger input</li>
        </ul>
        If a better source disproves a Fact, it fails. If a Theory loses its foundation, it collapses.<br>
        Because truth isn't what survives tradition. <strong>Truth is what survives pressure.</strong>
